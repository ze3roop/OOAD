# Project 2
### Names: 
  - ze3roop - Evan Thompson  
  - Aaron Anthony Grissom

### Java version:
  - JavaSE-19

### Assumptions: 
  1. Based off what I thought the Ending() function was supposed to be I printed all in stock AND all sold vehicles EACH day. This was just the way I interpreted it.
  2. Also, I wasn't sure when we were supposed to display the total departed staff, so I just put that after the 30 days of the simulation were over. 
  
### Note:
Unfortunately, Aaron could not assist with this project due to health problem, he has told me that he has emailed the professor about it.
